# About

This is my Capstone project for Microverse's JavaScript course. In this project, the goal was to build a shooter game using JavaScript and the game engine Phaser.

All project requirements can be seen [here](https://www.notion.so/Shooter-game-203e819041c7486bb36f9e65faecba27)

# About the Game

Space Burna is a classic shooting game that happens on the space. The goal is to survive for the longest possible time, while you destroy the enemies and avoid being shot to death. Each enemy destroied gives you 10 points. Earn enough points to see your name on the score board.

## How to play

The player controls a spaceship. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move around. To shoot, press enter.

## Characters

- **Player Spaceship**

![Player spaceship](/assets/player.png)

This is your spaceship. You can move it up, down, left and right using the arrow keys. You can also shoot by pressing enter.
It starts the game with 100% of health. If you got shot, the health decreases by 25%, so watch out!

- **GunShip**

![Gunship](/assets/enemy0.png)

This enemy has the guns, and there are lots of them around the space. Luckily, they are very predictable and easy to destroy.

- **ChaserShip**

![Chasership](/assets/enemy1.png)

These little ship looks nice, but it will chase you down until they hit you.

- **Meteors**

Watch out for the meteors. They are big and hard to destroy.

- **Bonus items**

Finally something good! There are two kind of bonus items: 

1) Extra shooting power: it adds multiple shots. You can have up to three at the same time.
Very handy when there are a lot of enemies to destroy. However, if you got shot, your shooting power decreases.

2) Shield: this bonus will give your spaceship a temporary shield. During this time, enemies' lasers won't hit you.
Also, if you collide with an enemy, it will explode.

## Scenes

This game have five scenes:
